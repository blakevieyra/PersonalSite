		<h1>About Me</h1> 
		
		<div class = "text">
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What can I say, I been around a few times. Not by choice of course. As the oldest son in a military family, I
			lived in several different states, and some of them were much better than others. I learned how to be 
			adaptable and to get ready to move at a moments notice. I probably moved more than 20 times in my live, to more than 20 different
			jobs, schools, and cities, and more the 20 different opportunites to make new friends and say goodbye to old ones.
			<br><br>
			More about me, I liked to play acoustic and electric guitar and like to dabble in audio production. That has been a hobby of mine since I was a teenager, 
			and as of the pandemic, I finally got around to building my own home studio for producing songs. Mostly beats and electronic music,
			but one day I hope to have all types of singer and collaborators join in. I also game, have an high end gaming PC and play
			the RPGs and shooters when they come out. My other hobbies are outdoor activites like camping, hiking, fishing, and hunting. 
			I really enjoy taking pictures, another hobby I picked up during the pandemic. My son and I enjoy role playing with eachother around
			telling eachother made up stories. I have a dog named Princess who is 6 months old and she is a mix of husky, german shepard, pitbull, and doberman pincher. She is 
			wild and high energy.
			<br><br> Sometime, when time and energy allows, I like to volunteer with the community, either the church or the 
			community food bank. But mostly spend leisure time watching movies, playing games, enjoying our hobbies, and enjoying life as we know it.
